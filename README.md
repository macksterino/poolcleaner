# @macksterino/poolcleaner

A very simple console application that simulates a pool cleaning robot's movement and predicts its end position. It takes three inputs; the length of both X and Y of the pool the robot is in, the initial direction, x- and y-axis of the robot and finally a set of commands describing how the robot should move.

## Usage
`git clone https://github.com/macksterino/poolcleaner.git && cd poolcleaner`

Requirements: Node.js
`npm install`

To start the application, do:
`node .`
